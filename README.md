# ALX Software Enginering Printf Team Project
This team project is a custom made printf function for the C programming language called `_printf`. It has been optimized to take various inputs and optional arguments based exactly on how the standard library function printf works. We submitted this as part of the `ALX software engineering course` requirement for grading.
